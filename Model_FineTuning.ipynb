    "#### Step 3: Model Fine-tuning\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B large language model, deploy the fine-tuned model, and test it's text generation and domain knowledge capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning refers to the process of taking a pre-trained language model and retraining it for a different but related task using specific data. This approach is also known as transfer learning, which involves transferring the knowledge learned from one task to another. Large language models (LLMs) like Llama 2 7B are trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data and can be fine-tuned on domain domain datasets, making the model perform better on that specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: A train and an optional validation directory. Each directory contains a CSV/JSON/TXT file.\n",
    "For CSV/JSON files, the train or validation data is used from the column called 'text' or the first column if no column called 'text' is found.\n",
    "The number of files under train and validation should equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You'll choose your dataset below based on the domain you've chosen**\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: A trained model that can be deployed for inference.\\\n",
